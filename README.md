# AI4XR Winter School 2025

Welcome to the **AI4XR Winter School 2025** repository. This repository contains the presentation slides and tutorial resources used during the winter school.

Over the last few years there has been a rapid convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and eXtended Reality (XR). Many people now see XR as an ideal interface for AI systems, enabling seamless integration with both real and virtual worlds. The winter school is designed to provide researchers and practitioners with foundational knowledge in AI and XR, and to explore how these technologies can be combined.

## About the Course

- **No prior knowledge required** – the course assumes no background in AI, XR or programming.
- **Hands‑on approach** – each day contains a mix of lectures and practical group work.
- **Full‑time short course** – the event runs for eight hours a day, with approximately 2–3 hours of instruction and 4–6 hours of project work.
- **Location** – the winter school takes place at the **Mawson Lakes campus, University of South Australia**.

Confirmed speakers include researchers and practitioners from academia and industry:

- Mark Billinghurst (University of South Australia)
